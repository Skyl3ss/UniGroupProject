## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

SwissQuiz is an interactive online quiz about the geography of Switzerland. In each round, players will be shown a random image taken somewhere in Switzerland. Your task is to guess where the image was taken by clicking on a map of Switzerland. The application thus allows you to discover and explore the beauty of Switzerland in a playful manner.

## Technologies <a id="technologies"></a>

The following technologies were used for front-end development:

* [JavaScript]() - Programming language
* [REACT](https://reactjs.org/) - JavaScript library used for building user interfaces
* [React Leaflet](https://react-leaflet.js.org) - React libarary used for generating maps of Switzerland
* [Axios API](https://axios-http.com/docs/api_intro) - JavaScript library used for REST-based communication with the server
* [Stomp](https://stomp-js.github.io/stomp-websocket/) - Messaging protocol used for websocket communication with the server
* [Unsplash API](https://unsplash.com/documentation) - API used for importing pictures into the game

## High-level Components <a id="high-level-components"></a>

### GameSetup

The [GameSetup component](https://github.com/sopra-fs24-group-37/sopra-fs24-client/blob/main/src/components/views/GameSetup.tsx) is a pivotal element of our application, enabling users to create new games seamlessly. Accessing the GameSetup view automatically creates a game object in the backend via a websocket connection. The relevant game is then automatically displayed in the [Lobby component](https://github.com/sopra-fs24-group-37/sopra-fs24-client/blob/main/src/components/views/Lobby.tsx) component, where other users can join by clicking on it. The creator of the game, known as the "game master," has the authority to configure key game settings in the [GameSettings component](https://github.com/sopra-fs24-group-37/sopra-fs24-client/blob/main/src/components/views/GameSettings.tsx), such as the guessing time for each round (10, 20, or 30 seconds) and the total number of rounds (3, 5, or 10). Additionally, the game master can set the game to private, which generates a unique six-digit PIN. This PIN must be entered by other users to join the private game, ensuring controlled access. Applying the game parameters updates the relevant game object via a websocket connection. 
  
### GameRound

The [GameRound component](https://github.com/sopra-fs24-group-37/sopra-fs24-client/blob/main/src/components/views/GameRound.tsx) is the core of our application, managing the entire game flow. In each round, players are presented with a random image sourced from the Unsplash API, which is distributed to all participants via a websocket connection from the backend. Players then guess the location where the image was taken by clicking on a map of Switzerland.

To enhance gameplay, players can use three distinct power-ups, each available once per game:

- **Double Score**: Doubles the points for the current round.
- **Canton Hint**: Highlights the boundaries of the canton where the image was taken.
- **Triple Hint**: Highlights the boundaries of three cantons, one of which contains the location where the image was taken.

At the end of each round, players' guesses and information about the used power-ups are transmitted back to the backend via the websocket connection.

### SwissMap

The [SwissMap component](https://github.com/sopra-fs24-group-37/sopra-fs24-client/blob/main/src/components/ui/SwissMap.tsx) is crucial for our application, as it allows players to submit guesses during a game round. The application was built using the [React Leaflet library](https://react-leaflet.js.org) and uses the [World Ocean Base layer by Esri](https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/esri::world-ocean-base/about) in combination with geojson dataset from [swisstopo](https://www.swisstopo.admin.ch/de/landschaftsmodell-swissboundaries3d) to render the geographical surface as well as  the national boundaries of Switzerland. A second geojson dataset is used to dynamically render the boundaries of cantons if a related power-up is used (see above). The map tracks the location guesses made by players and communicates them to the [GameRound component](https://github.com/sopra-fs24-group-37/sopra-fs24-client/blob/main/src/components/views/GameRound.tsx), into which it is visually integrated.

## Roadmap <a id="roadmap"></a>

Here are some suggestions on how to expand the existing application:

- **Editable avatar icons**: Players are prompted to select an avatar icon when registering for the first time. This avatar icon can then be changed in the user profile view. 
- **Image filtering for games**: In the GameSettings view, players can select different filtering parameters which are then applied to the images imported from the Unsplash API. Such filters could be geographical (e.g. only import images from a certain area) or topical (e.g. only import images of cities).
- **Overview of images displayed during the game**: After a game has ended, players have the option to go to a view that lists all the pictures that were shown during the game.

<!-- ## Getting started

Read and go through these Tutorials. It will make your life easier:)

- Read the React [Docs](https://react.dev/learn)
- Do this React [Getting Started](https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe) Tutorial (it doesn't assume any existing React knowledge)
- Get an Understanding of [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/Css/), [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/syntax), and [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp)!

Next, there are two other technologies that you should look at:

* [react-router-dom](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/start/concepts) offers declarative routing for React. It is a collection of navigational components that fit nicely with the application. 
* [react-hooks](https://blog.logrocket.com/using-hooks-react-router/) let you access the router's state and perform navigation from inside your components.

## Prerequisites and Installation
For your local development environment, you will need Node.js.\
We urge you to install the exact version **v20.11.0** which comes with the npm package manager. You can download it [here](https://nodejs.org/download/release/v20.11.0/).\
If you are confused about which download to choose, feel free to use these direct links:

- **MacOS:** [node-v20.11.0.pkg](https://nodejs.org/download/release/v20.11.0/node-v20.11.0.pkg)
- **Windows 32-bit:** [node-v20.11.0-x86.msi](https://nodejs.org/download/release/v20.11.0/node-v20.11.0-x86.msi)
- **Windows 64-bit:** [node-v20.11.0-x64.msi](https://nodejs.org/download/release/v20.11.0/node-v20.11.0-x64.msi)
- **Linux:** [node-v20.11.0.tar.xz](https://nodejs.org/dist/v20.11.0/node-v20.11.0-linux-x64.tar.xz) (use this [installation guide](https://github.com/nodejs/help/wiki/Installation#how-to-install-nodejs-via-binary-archive-on-linux) if you are new to Linux)

If you happen to have a package manager the following commands can be used:

- **Homebrew:**Â `brew install node@20.11.0`
- **Chocolatey:**Â `choco install nodejs-lts --version=20.11.0`

After the installation, update the npm package manager to **10.4.0** by running ```npm install -g npm@10.4.0```\
You can ensure the correct version of node and npm by running ```node -v``` and ```npm --version```, which should give you **v20.11.0** and **10.4.0** respectively.\
Before you start your application for the first time, run this command to install all other dependencies, including React:

```npm install```

Next, you can start the app with:

```npm run dev```

Now you can open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.\
Notice that the page will reload if you make any edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console (use a Chrome-based browser).\
The client will send HTTP requests to the server which can be found [here](https://github.com/HASEL-UZH/sopra-fs24-template-server).\
In order for these requests to work, you need to install and start the server as well.

### Testing
Testing is optional, and you can run the tests with `npm run test`\
This launches the test runner in an interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

> For macOS user running into a 'fsevents' error: https://github.com/jest-community/vscode-jest/issues/423

### Build
Finally, `npm run build` builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance:\
The build is minified, and the filenames include hashes.<br>

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
