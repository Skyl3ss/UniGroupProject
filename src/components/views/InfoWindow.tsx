        <strong>SwissQuiz</strong> is an interactive online quiz about the
        geography of Switzerland. In each round, you will see a random image
        from somewhere in Switzerland. Your task is to guess where the image was
        taken by clicking on a map of Switzerland.

      <h2>üïπÔ∏è Game Parameters</h2>
      <p>
        The gamemaster, who initiates a game, can set a number of game
        parameters:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Number of rounds</strong>: sets the number of rounds to be
          played in one game.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Guessing time</strong>: sets the time interval for making a
          guess.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Private game</strong>: will create a 6-digit PIN for the game
          such that only players with the PIN can join it. A game will stay
