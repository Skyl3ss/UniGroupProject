# Week 1 (Mar 27 – Apr 02)
## Diana Hidvegi
*Note:* This week I did not yet know how to properly link the commits to issues, so I linked one mutual commit to all these issues after pushing my changes. [Bulk Commit Link](https://github.com/sopra-fs24-group-37/sopra-fs24-server/pull/84/commits/ea49d6e8529cdc04edd272e2a721800a6a4697ea)
